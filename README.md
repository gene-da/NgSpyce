# NgSpyce

**NgSpyce** is a Pythonic EDA environment and interface logic tool for working with [NgSpice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/). It lets you build, edit, simulate, and visualize SPICE-compatible circuits â€” all from a clean, scriptable Python environment.

> Think of it as your digital workbench: create circuits, run simulations, and observe results without ever touching a .cir file by hand.
